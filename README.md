 📝  Autonomous Waste Sorting Robot

```markdown
🗑️ Autonomous Waste Sorting Robot

A Mechatronics engineering project that uses sensors, actuators, and Arduino to detect and sort waste into categories: **Plastic**, **Metal**, and **Organic** — promoting automation in environmental sustainability.

---

 🤖 Project Overview

This robot is designed to autonomously identify and sort waste items using sensor data and mechanical actuators. It uses an Arduino Uno as the control unit and is developed with simulation support from Proteus and modeled in SolidWorks.

---

 🔧 Features

- 🔍 Waste type detection using sensors
- ⚙️ Servo motors for flap/door control
- 🌀 Stepper motor for rotating platform/bin alignment
- 🧠 Logic control with Arduino Uno
- 🖥️ Proteus simulation and SolidWorks mechanical design

🚀 How It Works

1. Detection: Sensors identify the type of waste.
2. Decision Making: Arduino processes data to determine category.
3. Actuation:
   - Servo rotates sorting flap to direct waste.
   - Stepper aligns waste container below the flap.
4. Sorting: Waste is dropped into the correct bin automatically.
